Freeseer is a video capture program capable of capturing desktop or vga
input and mixing it with audio to create a video. It is optimized
for capturing presentations and demonstrations.

Freeseer is written in Python, and uses Qt4 for its
GUI. It also uses Gstreamer for video/audio processing.

Our packages will handle these dependencies automatically.

Freeseer is licensed under the GPL license, version 3.

Freeseer supports free (royalty free) audio and video codecs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

To develop freeseer, you require:
    Make, Git, PyQT development tools

If you are pulling the code from git, then you should install
the following packages first.

On typical fresh Fedora Core install:
    “sudo yum install git make PyQt4-devel python-feedparser.noarch”    

On typical fresh Ubuntu install:
    “sudo apt-get install git-core pyqt4-dev-tools python-feedparser”

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you have the prerequisite componets, build freeseer by changing
directory into the src directory, and run:
    "make"

This will compile the gui files. Once this completes, you can run:
    "./freeseer"

This starts up the Freeseer GUI.

If you wish to capture vga input using epiphan's vga2usb device:
    first, copy the vga2usb.ko driver to /lib/modules/<kernel version>
    for the kernel you're running. Epiphan provides a list of pre-compiled
    drivers at http://epiphan.com

    Then, configure the driver:
    "sudo cp vga2usb.conf /etc/modprobe.d/; depmod -a"
